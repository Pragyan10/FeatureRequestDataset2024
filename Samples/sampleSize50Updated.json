Muting a user or a group does not really solve the problem, either. Wanting a certain user removed from a group does not usually mean that group members no longer want to hear from the group in general, nor does it necessarily mean that group members want the user muted in private conversations or other groups. Example given: a group of colleagues to discuss job related tasks. If one of the group members leaves the team or company, that person should no longer have access to the group, but people may still be friends with that person and keep communicating in private and in other, non work-related groups. Rebuildung large groups whenever a member is supposed to leave, is not a viable option. Why can the creator of a group not hold some key locally that identifies him as administrator of that group? Whoever has the key can alter the group. If someone without admin status wants to add a member, an amdin has to approve it. If the key is lost, the group can no longer be altered. However, if all users leave a group, it will be closed. So you could give up a group, if that happens.", "Images: ": []}, {"Text: ": "Greetings. Really not sure about the logic in posting to a closed thread... This is a complicated concept.  I originally was going to just say, \"me too,\" but that obviously went out of control. I agree withgith-accountthat a central admin should be the sole person responsible for the thread/group.  The current solution of requiring members to unsubscribe or leave the group is not that great, but I understand the simplicity of it. gith-account As a safety, and to complicate things, there could be a mutiny feature, which would allow either a majority or a complete vote to \"kick\" the admin and assign a new admin.  The admin would not be allowed to vote.  This would also provide a backup if the admin loses their device, or just goes silent for an extended amount of time.  In situations where there is an even amount of recipients or voters and a tie occurs, an automatic re-vote would take place with a notification that there was a tie, then if the tie remains, no change would take place regarding the admin.  Any user, including the admin, could initiate a mutiny vote.  (Would be good if there was also the ability for the admin to voluntarily step down and assign a successor.)  All mutiny votes would require a single non-admin recipient be listed as the pending new admin.  The admin would not be kicked from the group following a successful mutiny, they would simply be demoted.  If the new admin decides to kick them, so be it. Something that would push into another feature request would be the ability to remotely destroy threads.  If a device is lost or stolen, then the authentication to remotely kill the old instance would be the private key (from a backup).  No backup, no remote kill.  Related threads:#1764,#5713,#643 #1764 #5713 #643 Group conversations would have to provide some type of secondary/tertiary key, unique to that thread.  The necessary portion of the key to authenticate would need to be sent to the admin of the group.  In a case of a mutiny, the keys would need to be regenerated by all members and passed to the new admin (the old admin would have bad keys and could be purged by the old admin when they next do a backup).  This key would obviously also have to be included in any backup done by the active admin.  (I am not sure how groups are currently encrypted ... using each recipients individual keys or by creating a new key ... if via a new key then a third key would be required for this feature.) I mention this remote kill feature because it is applicable to a group discussion in which sensitive information is shared, but a user is removed from the group, or a user loses their device.  This is also applicable for all recipients of a group that are kicked from the group.  The admin could then initiate a member validation check in which selected members optionally have their conversation history wiped, then are kicked from the group.  I say, \"optionally,\" to allow the admin the option to wipe their conversation or not, as sometimes it may be acceptable for the kicked recipient to retain the conversation history to that point.  If it is not acceptable for them to retain it, then the admin would make that decision when kicking them.  This could not be changed once the kick is completed.  Related threads:#5455,#5594 #5455 #5594 Oh yeah, the other aspect of group administration which is a wee bit frustrating is that anyone can force anyone into a group.  I would like for membership to be voluntary rather than mandatory.  Well, as I am typing this I just realized I have only added people to a group and have never been added to a group ... so it may be voluntary currently.  If not, see first two sentences of this paragraph.  :) With regard to non-admin's making kick requests, these can realistically just be done directly, outside of the group thread.  For instance, if USER1 wants to kick USER6, rather than create a new capability within the group administration for this type of request, USER1 could just directly communicate, outside of the group, with the ADMIN and say something like, \"Yo, USER6 is a lame anchor, I recommend you kick them.\" FWIW, i may be open to publishing this post in hardback for an early release next summer ....", "Images: ": []}, {"Text: ": "@TimesEnemyThat seemswaytoo complex, not only to develop but also as a Signal user.

I think what he wants to say is, that they don't have a choice, as with for example bittorrent (TOR uses routers and not every client is a router) the user knows (or at least should know), that other peoples activities, if surveilled, may lead to him getting in trouble. But he can choose to use bittorrent or not. And with special privacy tools like I2P, the prosecution/police knows, that they can't just bust somebody if his computer delivered a certain message, because it may well have come from somebody else, who the user doesn't know. But the police in undemocratic countries doesn't currently know that users may get unsolicited messages from political activists and protesters.So they will probably just \"interrogate\" them, which would basically be our fault.  Consider the current situation:Only people who actually DO have something to hide install TS.  Only people who actually DO have something to hide install TS. This would mean the state wouldn't even have to suveil all phone numbers to find activists with DPI (for SMS), they just start with one activist using TS and he'll text all the others. And they are unconnected, which means the police wouldn't even have found out about the other TS users (which probably also have something to hide)They would only have to bag them all and throw them into some dark hole. First because they don't know about the technology, and later because they found that, even if the people aren't connected to the original suspect, they still confess to a lot of \"crimes\" when interrogated, because they assume the police found out about their political activities and is interrogating them because of those, not some random message they don't even know they even received.And TS would pretty quickly be called a spy tool by the opposition, meaning that nobody will use it anymore.   How about putting nearby users in the same location bucket?Then we would have a database on the server connecting phone numbers to TextSecure users.That would mean not only the local cellphone provider and state could know who uses this \"subversive tool\" via DPI, but everybody who may compromise the servers.I don't think that's too bad, because the information is only critical for the local authorities, who can get them the old fashioned way, but we should consider it.

You'd have to maintain it regularly by updating the timestamps and possibly contacts and unless you're purely using the data channel a law enforcement figure would have the meta data about the communications already and probably the unsecure messages making it difficult to say those are the only messages that were kept in your phone when they don't match up with what they got from your service provider.", "Images: ": []}, {"Text: ": "GitHub Issue Cleanup:See#7598for more information.  #7598", "Images: ": []}]}, {"App Name": "Signal", "Request Number": "#6592", "Title": "[Feature] Add a private PDF previewer", "Author": "vvug", "Posted Time": "Apr 27, 2017", "Initial Comment": "It would be very useful to be able to view PDF documents without saving them unencrypted and with a viewer that is guaranteed not to connect to the Internet or do other nasty things.
